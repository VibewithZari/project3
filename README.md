My application is a trivia app that is based on common knowledge that ranges from math, personal interest, and geography.
Features implemented: The features implemented are the homescreen, question screen and the result screen. 
Specific contributions:  I coded everything by myself, I went based on my lab 10 assignment which was to build a quiz app, but this time I added more question types. I did add images from Google that are backed by the creative commons license.
