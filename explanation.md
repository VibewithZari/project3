 chose Option 2 which is to make a new trivia app with new question types. I made three components and three screens aaccording to the requirements. App.js is a state component. QuestionScreen and ResultScreen are the two input components. This is because the QuestionScreen and ResultScreen gets the updated value from App component.
States: The only state that I have are the questions. 
Parameters: In my questionScreen, I am passing the props which are onAnswerChange and question, and in the result component, the parameters are score and questions. 
Input Components: The input components is types which are multiple choice, survey, drop down and text input.
